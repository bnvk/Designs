## Copy/Move Mappings

Often times I find myself about to do an action to get files from one VM to
another, but I need these files in a specific location:

```
/home/user/Project-A/images/
```

There are multiple ways to do this action with the existing tools. But honestly
the easiest route currently for me is to use Git and push/pull

This should be simpler, IMHO. Perhaps there is way to create a utility that
"remembers" a more specific mapping, such as:

Starting VM 

```
/home/user/Designs/Project-A/images/
```

Ending VM

```
/home/user/Code/Project-A/
```

And then reducing all those steps into a simple button that is only visible in
Starting VM path in the File Manager. Or perhaps a shortcut in the right click
menu like "Quick Copy to Code..."
